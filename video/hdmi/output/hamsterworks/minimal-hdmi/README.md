Hamsterworks' Minimal HDMI
===========================

> After completing my Minimal DVI-D project I wanted to get a Minimal HDMI
> output working.
>
> Please note that these are my notes about implementing a minimally functional
> HDMI-compatible output stream, and isn't a serious attempt at implementing
> HDMI. It includes many short cuts and assumptions and most likely a few
> errors. It is here purely for educational purposes, and might be of use to
> somebody doing a proper job of implementing HDMI.
